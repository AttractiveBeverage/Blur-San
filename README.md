# Blur-San
Have you ever wondered what it would be like if the Blur Sphere from Hideous Destructor was an anime girl? Well now you can find out, with Blur-San!

This is a sprite and sound replacement for the Hideous Destructor Blur Sphere.
This "mod" only replaces sounds and sprites, so it should be fully multiplayer compatable.
