# Blur-San
Have you ever wondered what it would be like if the Blur Sphere from Hideous Destructor was an obsessive anime girl? Well now you can find out, with Blur-San, the best and only anime girl Blur Sphere!
What can she do? She burns your foes, turns you invisible, whispers sweet things into your ear (and gets **way** too attachted). 

This is a sprite and sound replacement for the Hideous Destructor Blur Sphere.
This "mod" only replaces sounds and sprites, so it should be fully multiplayer compatable.
